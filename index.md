Hello, World!

Welcome to my page! I am a third-year Math-CS major with a minor in Interdisciplinary Computing and Music at UCSD. Previous programming classes that I have enjoyed taking during my time at UCSD include:
- CSE 12
- CSE 30
- CSE 100
- DSC 10
I'm currently taking CSE 110, my first ever software engineering course and I'm super excited to start working with a team on whatever project we are given to make!

1. C++
2. Python
3. Java
