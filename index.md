Hello, World!
```
**Welcome to my page!** I am a third-year Math-CS major with a minor in Interdisciplinary Computing and Music at UCSD. Previous programming classes that I have enjoyed taking during my time at UCSD include:
- CSE 12
- CSE 30
- CSE 100
- DSC 10

I'm currently taking CSE 110, my first ever software engineering course and I'm super excited to start working with a team on whatever project we are given to make!

Like many programmers, I there are some languages I like to use over others. Ordered from which languages I like best, and which I like least, these are:
1. C++
2. Python
3. Java
4. C
My checklist for CSE 110 are as follows:
- [ ] Become more familiar in working with a team
- [ ] Learn common development practices
- [ ] Familiarize myself better with HTML/CSS/Javascript
- [ ] Be able to build some piece of software over the course of the coming 10 weeks

Outside of classes, my favorite thing to do is music. I have been a percussionist for almost 7 years now, and I'm involved with many music related activities outside of campus. Most recently, I am a member of the orchestra for Muir Musical's production of Into the Woods.
